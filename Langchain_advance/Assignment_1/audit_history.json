        "output": "Optimization Report\n- Title: Improve Performance and Structure for Better User Experience\n- Why it is required: The current performance score of 85% and structure score of 90% indicate that while the site is well-structured, there is still room for improvement in terms of performance, particularly in reducing the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) time of 1.2s and Total Blocking Time (TBT) of 150ms, to provide a better user experience.\n- Complexity: Medium\n- Impact: Medium to High (Expected Performance Gain: 10-20% improvement in page load times and user engagement)\n- Dev Notes: To improve performance, consider optimizing images, minifying CSS and JavaScript files, leveraging browser caching, and reducing the number of HTTP requests. For structure, ensure proper HTML tagging, optimize meta tags, and improve internal linking. Specifically, focus on reducing LCP by optimizing critical rendering path elements and improving TBT by reducing the impact of non-essential scripts on the main thread."
